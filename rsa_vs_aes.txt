RSA vs AES:
                                            
                                            RSA is asymmetric and ideal for encrypting small data like keys. It is slower and requires more processing power.
                                            AES is symmetric, much faster, and suited for encrypting large data. In practice, RSA is used to encrypt AES keys,
                                            while AES encrypts the actual data. This hybrid approach combines the benefits of both.
